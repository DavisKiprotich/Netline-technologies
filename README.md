# Netline Technologies Website design
I will be creating my company's website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript .
I will be giving brief descriptions about my journey and the challenges that i may have faced along the way.

## HTML Structure 
We have structured our code using divs. Our main div is the profile section which has been subdivided into two sections namely nav bar and the content div.

## Colors ##
I used grey as a primary color, blue as the secondary color and aliceblue as the second secondary color.

## Home Page ##
I want a landing page with a video on its background, nav bar , logo ,catchpharse and a simple nav tool to the second section.

**nav bar**
The navigation bar is composed of a logo image which is linked to the home page when clicked and the unordered list .The logo image is placed on the top left of the landing page.The ul list has two items with the dropdown menu. The navigation links use chakra petch styling which gives an engineering aspect to our letters.Moreover, the navs change color to grey from aliceblue color when hovered.

**Dropdown menus**
These dropdown menus are aligned at two navigation links .They are positioned to be diplayed at the bottom of the nav link .Its transparent background and the box shadow provides a beautiful appearance(I keep reading its styling to confirm its existence lol).
