# Netline Technologies Website design
I will be creating my company's website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript .
I will be giving brief descriptions about my journey and the challenges that i may have faced along the way.

## HTML Structure 
We have structured our code using divs. Our main div is the profile section which has been subdivided into two sections namely nav bar and the content div.

**nav**
The navigation bar is composed of a logo image which is linked to the home page when clicked and the unordered list .The logo image is placed on the top left of the landing page.The ul list has two items with the dropdown menu.
